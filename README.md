维摩诘言。 诸姊有法门名无尽灯。汝等当学。无尽灯者。譬如一灯燃百千灯。冥者 皆明。明终不尽。如是诸姊。夫一菩萨开导百千众生。令发阿耨多罗三 藐三菩提心。于其道意亦不灭尽。随所说法而自增益一切善法。是名无 尽灯也。汝等虽住魔宫。以是无尽灯。令无数天子天女发阿耨多罗三藐 三菩提心者。为报佛恩。亦大饶益一切众生。尔时天女。头面礼维摩诘 足。随魔还宫忽然不现。


“Vimalakīrti replied, ‘Sisters, there is a door of the Dharma called “The Inexhaustible Lamp.” Practice it! What is it? Sisters, a single lamp may light hundreds of thousands of lamps without itself being diminished. Likewise, sisters, a single bodhisattva may establish many hundreds of thousands of living beings in enlightenment without his mindfulness being diminished. In fact, not only does it not diminish, it grows stronger. Likewise, the more you teach and demonstrate virtuous qualities to others, the more you grow with respect to these virtuous qualities. This is the door of the Dharma called “The Inexhaustible Lamp.” When you are living in the realm of Māra, inspire innumerable gods and goddesses with the spirit of enlightenment. In such a way, you will repay the kindness of the Tathāgata, and you will become the benefactors of all living beings.’
“Then, those goddesses bowed at the feet of the Licchavi Vimalakīrti and departed in the company of Māra.
